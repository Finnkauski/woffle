# chatter

Testing alternative techniques, libraries and functions for
[optimus](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/optimus).

Nothing much to see here. If you do wish to use the program just dump your data
into `data` (cunning huh?) and then change line 20 to reflect the name of your
input dataset. This data should be one description per line. Processed data will
be in `output`.
