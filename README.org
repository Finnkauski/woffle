* Introduction

Developing the future of [[https://github.com/datasciencecampus/optimus][optimus]].


Nothing much to see here, yet. If you do wish to use the program just dump your data
into `data` (cunning huh?) and then change line 20 to reflect the name of your
input dataset. This data should be one description per line. Processed data will
be in `output`. Instructions for further use and how to implement your own model
will be added to the wiki in due time.
