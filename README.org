* Introduction

Testing alternative techniques, libraries and functions for [[https://github.com/datasciencecampus/optimus][o p t i m u s]].

Nothing much to see here. If you do wish to use the program just dump your data
into `data` (cunning huh?) and then change line 20 to reflect the name of your
input dataset. This data should be one description per line. Processed data will
be in `output`.


** WIP [0%]:
- [ ] Restructure code to facilitate common interface for the model based side of things
- [ ] Incorporate travisCI
- [ ] Replace requirements.txt with a shell script to allow installation of preferred models
